All the 10 worst path pass through the GENERATE BLOCKS of the carry generator component. 
This part of the path is the most critical and requires most of the time.
The differences among the 10 worst path are related to the bits on the output with the highest significance (in this case s31 s30 s29 s28 s27 s26 s25 s24 s23 s22): the first 4 of them are related to the last carry select block, the group (s27 s26 s25 s24) are related to the one before the last carry select block and so on. 
This is due to the fact that their carries are generated on the same level of the carry generator tree, at the last level, and have to wait all the 'generate block' on the previous levels of the tree.
In conclusion, every analyzed path has the same latency because their carry is generated on the same level on the carry generator tree (the last one in this case).  

the worst case of the carry generator is the one ending in the block that generates the last carry (C32) and passes through the other Generate Blocks.

the worst cases of the sum generator are the path that need the last carries generated by the carry generator, because the latency of the additions is smaller than that.
